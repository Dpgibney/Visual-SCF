Need to fork the ryven repo and update the args parsing to get it to work properly
Need to fix the orbital visualizers (MO and AO) currently if there is only positive nodes they break 
	Refactor to reduce reusing code!!

Need to test out a "Go" button
	Could potentially just make a button that returns true when pressed and None otherwise? That way it can send the update connected nodes
	Can also have it update the button to "Ready" and "Running"?

Need to push this to github at some point
Need to create the stepwise SCF procedure
Look into creating an initial tutorial with what you have to see what you're missing
Update the molecule node to work with charges and non-singlet systems!
Write a bonding box algorithm to figure out where to sample the isosurface from
Need to graph the atoms (Should they be different colors based on the atom?)
Need to set different colors for the positive and negative orbital lobes
Need to add transparency to the orbitals 
Make a matrix viewer or mo coefficient viewer
Update the beta block and the AO viewer to show the orbitals in the correct location and to put in the atoms!
Add the atomic orbital names to the MO coefficient viewer
find a way to emphasis that the MO coefficients transform from the atomic orbitals to the Molecular!!!! (Unitary matrix)
